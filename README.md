# Food Finder

This project was assignment for the bootcamp that I am currently attending. For this assingnment I had to use an API and UseEffect to create a webpage of my choice. I chose to create a "online recipe book". The user can search for recipes using as many or as few of the filters as they would like. It will then give the user 10 different recipes to choice from. Once the user chooses a recipe they will get a summary about the recipe, the ingredients they would need to make the recipe, the instructions on how to make it, and information about the servings including the nutrition facts. Check it out here.

# My Motivation
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.
I really enjoyed using React for this project. Over the last few weeks React has become one of my favorite tools to use. I choose to create the recipe page because I saw an example and thought it was a great idea. I seemed within my scope of capabilities which made me confident that I could complete it in time. However there were a few aspects that were still challenging enough to keep me engaged and still learning. Also, after reviewing and API documentation and making few practices requests, I felt more capable of properly using the API without running into too many barriers. In addition, the API provided extensive information about each of the recipes. So much so that I didnt use all of it simply becuase I felt like it might not be needed. I will also be using this project for my personal use.
